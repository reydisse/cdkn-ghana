At a youth focused event in Accra, a group of teenagers got a chance to learn about climate change in a fun and engaging way, through the Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN) innovative knowledge brokering initiative. This event showed that learning about climate issues can be enjoyable and interactive, especially for young people. Here’s a look at how this event used games and activities to teach climate change and highlights CDKN's role in making climate education accessible to everyone.

**Interactive Learning with Games**

The event started with forty teenagers, ready to learn and have fun. CDKN chose to use the Kahoot app, a game-based learning platform, to make the session interesting. The teens formed teams and each team was given an electronic device to play the game. They began with an icebreaker game, which helped everyone relax and get to know each other, especially their team members. The game was simple and fun, and it set a friendly atmosphere for the rest of the session.

**Kahoot! Bringing Climate Education to Life**

Once everyone was comfortable, the real fun began with the Kahoot app. The game had questions about climate change, and each team tried to answer them correctly. The teens enjoyed the competition and learned important facts about climate change at the same time. Even those who didn’t know much about the topic stayed engaged and interested. As the game progressed, the excitement grew, especially in the final rounds where the teams were eager to win.

**More Than Just a Game**

By the end of the gaming session, it was clear that this approach to learning worked well. The teens not only learned about climate change but also had a great time doing it. They became closer as a group and were eager to participate in more activities like this in the future. The organizers were happy to see that the session was both educational and enjoyable.

**CDKN’s Role in Making Learning Fun**

This event is a good example of CDKN’s commitment to making climate education interesting and accessible to different groups of people, including young students. By using interactive tools like games, CDKN is helping to teach important topics in a way that’s easy to understand and fun to participate in. This approach is important for getting more people, especially the younger generation, interested in and informed about climate issues.

In summary, the event was more than just a fun day; it was a successful attempt at making climate education engaging and understandable. This event shows how CDKN is helping to bring about a future where everyone is more aware and informed about climate change.
